# Day 16: Music Visualizer behavior contract

## Objective

Build a round music visualizer whose frequency bands are mathematically testable before live audio.

## Shared platform contract

The target is the M5Stack Stopwatch with a corrected 468 × 466 drawable panel, rotation 0, x offset 6, and y offset 0.
BtnA is physical left and BtnB is physical right with the lanyard down.
Every touch consumer loads `espt-touch/record`, accepts safe version-1 and version-2 records, maps raw coordinates through the complete shared warp, and provides the shared runtime calibration flow.
No lesson-specific touch correction is permitted.

## Controls

Use the default grammar: BtnA/left is Previous or Decrease; BtnB/right is Next or Increase; short both is Enter; hold both for 600 ms is Back. Preserve the 80 ms join and overlap rules and consume chord clicks.
Touch and serial injection dispatch the same semantic action names.

## Portable state

- `focus`: enum, default `canvas`
- `style`: enum, default `radial`
- `sensitivity`: enum, default `medium`
- `frozen`: bool, default `False`
- `peak_band`: int, default `0`

State transitions are pure, deterministic, and leave their input value unchanged.
Every transition returns a state that satisfies the declared enum, integer, boolean, and string bounds.

## Behavior

1. Capture a fixed power-of-two frame, remove DC, apply a Hann window, compute magnitudes, and aggregate logarithmic bands.
2. Use separate attack and release constants so bars rise quickly and fall smoothly.
3. Focus Style and Sensitivity; cycle radial, bars, and orbit styles plus low, medium, and high gain.
4. Enter on the canvas freezes and resumes the displayed band frame without stopping capture.
5. Render every frame inside the 466-row panel and preserve the calibration record.

## Required scenarios

- **primary flow**: enter, enter
- **style cycle**: right, enter, enter
- **band update**: {'type': 'bands', 'peak': 7}, {'type': 'bands', 'peak': 12}

The JSON contract contains the exact intermediate expected state for each action.
It is normative when prose and a disposable candidate disagree.

## Visual contract

The reference frame is 468 × 466 and uses only rows 0–465.
The primary title, status, data, and control hint remain readable through a circular aperture.
Controls and their inset focus rings remain inside radius 226 from center `(234,233)`.
Touch targets are at least 42 pixels tall and lower controls remain unobstructed so the calibrated lower face is exercised.

## Persistence and failure contract

Only lesson-owned state may be written by this lesson.
The `espt-touch` namespace is read-only outside the shared calibration flow.
Validate persisted length, version, checksum where applicable, enum/range values, and string termination before use.
Network, sensor, audio, storage, allocation, and parse failures name their source on screen and over serial, retain the last safe state, and expose a bounded retry.

## Acceptance layers

1. The machine-readable contract passes three reducer shapes and rejects a deliberate mutation.
2. The selected portable implementation adds lesson-specific numerical, timing, parsing, and persistence tests.
3. The real libraries compile at pinned versions with no project warnings.
4. The instrumented device passes injected actions, capture, 20 largest-state loops, memory checks, and touch-map preservation.
5. A person reviews the physical controls, touch, cues, readability, clipping, bottom edge, and activity-specific behavior.

Each layer records only what it observes.
